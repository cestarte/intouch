# Future possibilities

  * Soft delete functionality
  * Upload files to a communication
  * Table sorting, filtering, and pagination
  * UI polish
    * Remember the last used collection
    * Move detail pane inside of tables (when routing to a new page isn't necessary)
  * Dashboard
    * Small widgets to show various numbers
    * Pie chart for "Who's waiting on me" vs "Who am I waiting on" vs "No expected action"
    * line chart to show # communications per week over the past few months

# Probably not happening
  * The app may get a password screen to prevent my kid from playing with it but I have no  plans to add real security. If you want to host this app in some place that anyone else can access, you should hire a developer to make it secure.
